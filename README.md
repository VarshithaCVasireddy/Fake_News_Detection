## Fake News Detection

## Author: Varshitha Choudary Vasireddy

## Description of the project:
&emsp;Fake news has become a major issue in todayâ€™s society, with its potential to cause signif- icant harm to individuals and communities by influencing public opinion and impacting elections. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for combating fake news, and this project aims at developing a model to accurately identify potentially fake news arti- cles using only their titles. A dataset was collected and preprocessed, and various machine learning and transfer learning techniques were employed to identify patterns and features that indicated the authenticity of an article. The results showed a high accuracy rate in detecting fake news articles using only their titles, highlighting the potential of machine learning in the fight against fake news.<br>
&emsp;Stopping the spread of fake news requires a multifaceted approach, including fact- checking, critical thinking, and media literacy education. Machine learning can play a significant role in this effort by providing automated tools to quickly and accurately detect fake news, allowing for timely interventions and corrections. The results of this study have the potential to benefit the general public, journalists and news organizations, and social media companies. By combatting the spread of fake news on social media platforms, the public can have access to more reliable and accurate information, improving civic engage- ment. This study provides a valuable tool for fact-checking and verifying information for journalists and news organizations, ultimately improving the quality and credibility of their reporting. Social media companies can also benefit by implementing machine learning al- gorithms to detect and remove fake news articles from their platforms, enhancing user trust and improving the integrity of their services. This project has demonstrated the potential of machine learning in identifying potential fake news articles and contributing to a more informed and trustworthy information ecosystem. <br>
